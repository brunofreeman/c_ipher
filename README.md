# c_ipher
`c_ipher` is a collection of ciphers implemented in C. Thus far, the following ciphers are available:

1. [Atbash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash)
2. [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

The `c_ipher` executable built by the included `CMakeLists.txt` can be used to encrypt and decrypt with the ciphers via the command line. The `c_ipher_tests` executable can be used to run the tests defined in the `def` directory.
